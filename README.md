# Custom Virtual Network with Mininet

Welcome to the repository for the Computer Networks assignment focusing on developing TCP calls using Mininet, a network emulation software. This assignment provides hands-on experience in creating a custom virtual network environment.

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practical experience in developing a custom virtual network using Mininet. The assignment specifically focuses on TCP calls within this virtual network environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Mininet:** Network emulation software used to create the custom virtual network environment.
  
- **Open vSwitch (OVS):** Software-defined networking (SDN) switch used within the Mininet environment.
  
- **POX:** OpenFlow SDN controller utilized to control the virtual Software Defined Network (SDN).

## Assignment Goals

- **Hands-on Experience:** Gain practical experience in setting up and configuring a custom virtual network.
  
- **Understanding SDN:** Explore the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, separating the control plane from the data plane.
  
- **TCP Calls:** Implement TCP calls within the virtual network environment, demonstrating networking concepts and protocols.
